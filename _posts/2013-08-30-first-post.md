<h3>First!</h3>
Here's my first post!  This site was created using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).  Inspirational sources for the layout include [Medium](http://www.medium.com) and [PracticalTypography](http://practicaltypography.com).  Maybe I'll rip off some other websites but until then this will suffice.


Still debating how to best format or organize this webpage and will likely play around with it some more. My hope for this website is that it will serve as a public repository for content I create - either veterinary ophthalmology related or computer-y related or whatever else happens to strike my fancy.

They web has changed pretty significantly since last I messed around with it. My old blog/website was a wordpress one. It's easy enough creating content with WordPress or blogger or any other commercially available blogging platform but I wanted a more "hands-on" way of development that would allow me to become more familiar with the latest and greatest in web development.

I spent probably 2-3 weeks familiarizing myself with what's out there before settling on what I have here.  There is an astounding amount of resources now for learning how to design for the web.  I used [CodeAcademy](http://www.codeacademy.com) - Web Fundamentals to pick up some css know-how (which has always confused me) and decided to utilize [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for generating css files.  There's a TON of design advice out there as well but I basically took the aforementioned sites whose layout I liked and used Chrome's inspect element to imitate what I saw.

I've learned about the apparently awesome [sublime text editor](http://www.sublimetext.com/), [github](github) for version control, [github hosting](http://pages.github.com/) for convenient hosting, [sass](http://sass-lang.com) for easier css generation, [markdown language](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for writing for web, and of course [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
I hope to continue tweaking the overall appearance of the site as well as creating separate pages with formats or technologies utilizing some of the neat things I've found online along the way.  It's a bit daunting to consider how much is out there that I haven't even scratched the surface of (JavaScript frameworks for example).
